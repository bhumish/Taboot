        - `task` The task to poll.
        - `sleep_interval` The number of seconds to wait before trying
                           the task again.
        - `max_attempts` The maximum number of attempts that the task
                         should be run.
        - `fail_task` The task to run when max_attempts has been exhausted.
                      If no fail_task is provided, then a simple TaskResult
                      indicating failure is returned.
